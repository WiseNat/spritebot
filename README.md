SpriteBot


Words words words 
I'll write better things here later B)


## Setup
This project uses [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/) to handle dependencies

Make sure you have python installed. Then, in a terminal window, run:

`pip install poetry`

Then install the dependencies with poetry:

`poetry install`

Next make a file at the root of this project called `.env` file to store the bot secret in. The contents of the file should look like this:

`BOT_SECRET=SECRET-GOES-HERE`


## Running

Run the following command in terminal:

`poetry run zigzag.py`
